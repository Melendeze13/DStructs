### FIFO Queue
Is an ADT that comprises two basic operations: insert (put), and 
delete (get) the item that was least recently inserted. Queue is another
fundamental ADT (Abstract Data Structure) that is similar to the stack,
but that uses the opposite rule to decide which element to remove for 
delete.
