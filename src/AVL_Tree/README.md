## AVL Tree
An AVL Tree is a Binary Search Tree (BST), the keys of which meet 
standard requirements: a key of any tree node is not less than the key 
in the left subtree of the given node and not more than any key in the 
right subtree of this node. This means that in order to find the 
necessary key in an AVL tree, we can use a standard algorithm. [1]
