## Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree is a rooted binary tree, whose internal nodes each store a 
key (and optionally, an associated value) and each have two distinguished sub-trees, 
commonly denoted left and right. The tree additionally satisfies the binary search 
tree property, which states that the key in each node must be greater than all keys 
stored in the left sub-tree, and not greater than all keys in the right sub-tree.
